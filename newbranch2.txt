created this file to learn about pull request
new branch2 is created in vsc and we have to move to github

create newbranch2 into vsc using command // git branch newbranch2
check the number of branches using command // git branch -a
push newbranch2 into github using // git push origin newbranch2

Since we dont have direct access to merge , we can use pull request to merge
go to pull req -> new pull req-> base: main to compare:newbranch2
create pull req and in description write what you want to pull
pull req notification  comes
merge pull req -> pull req is merged
